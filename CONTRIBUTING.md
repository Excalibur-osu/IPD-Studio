# Contributing to IPD Studio

Thanks for helping build the browser-native intelligent P&ID tool.
All contributions are welcome: bug fixes, new symbols, HMI widgets, docs,
translations of engineering conventions you know from your industry — even a
well-written bug report with a `.pnid` file attached moves the project.

## Your first contribution, step by step

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub (button top-right), then clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/IPD-Studio.git
   cd IPD-Studio
   npm install
   npm run dev        # editor at http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. **Pick something.** Issues labeled `good first issue` are sized for a first
   PR; `help wanted` are bigger but unclaimed. Or just fix what bugs you.
   For anything large, open an issue first so we agree on the approach
   before you invest the time.

3. **Branch** off `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/foot-valve-symbol   # feat/… fix/… docs/…
   ```

4. **Make the change, tests first.** Logic changes start with a failing test
   (see "Tests are the contract" below). Run the gates locally:

   ```bash
   npm test             # unit (vitest)
   npx playwright test  # e2e (starts its own dev server)
   npm run build        # type-check + production build
   ```

5. **Commit** in the conventional style used throughout the history:

   ```
   feat(pid): foot valve symbol with strainer hatch
   fix(hmi): trend hover cursor froze the wrong window
   ```

6. **Push and open a Pull Request** against `main`:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/foot-valve-symbol
   ```

   The PR template asks how you verified it — fill it honestly. CI runs the
   same gates on your PR, but a green local run first saves a round trip.

7. **Review.** Expect concrete feedback; push follow-up commits to the same
   branch (no force-push needed). Once approved it's squash-merged, and your
   change ships to [the live app](https://pid-studio-praharsh.web.app) with
   the next release.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

IPD Studio is **source-available under [PolyForm Noncommercial
1.0.0](LICENSE)**, and commercial licenses are sold to fund the project. For
that to work, one party has to be able to grant those commercial licenses.

So before a code PR can be merged, please paste this line into the PR (once —
it covers all your future contributions):

> I grant Praharsh Nagpure a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free
> license to use, modify, sublicense, and relicense my contribution, including
> under commercial terms. I confirm the work is mine to give and that my
> employer, if any, has no claim to it.

You keep the copyright to your contribution — this is a license grant, not an
assignment. It exists purely so commercial licenses can be sold without having
to track down every contributor.

**Nothing is required for** issues, bug reports, symbol requests, convention
corrections, or discussion. Those are the most valuable contributions anyway,
and they carry no paperwork.

If your employer's policy makes the CLA impossible, say so in the issue —
a convention correction that I implement myself is still a real contribution.

## What we especially need

- **Symbols** you miss from real drawings (follow "Adding a symbol" below —
  and the IP rule, always)
- **Industry review**: wrong conventions, wrong letter combinations, things a
  practicing I&C engineer would flinch at — file issues, you don't need to code
- **HMI widgets** and simulation depth (see `src/hmi/`)
- **Import/export fidelity**: DEXPI conformance, DXF quirks from real CAD files
- **Docs and examples**: a good example plant teaches more than a manual

## Dev setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # editor at localhost:5173
npm test             # vitest unit tests
npx playwright test  # e2e happy path
npm run build        # type-check + production build
```

## Architecture in one paragraph

The Zustand store (`src/store`) owns the document — plain JSON, immutable
updates, zundo undo. JointJS renders it through a one-way reconciler
(`src/canvas/reconciler.ts`); every user gesture becomes a store action, never
a direct graph mutation. Pure logic (ISA tables, tag parsing, validation,
CSV/exports, glyph geometry) lives in DOM-free modules with table-driven
tests. Symbols are data (`src/symbols/lib`): SVG-string renderers plus port
definitions parsed to JointJS markup by `src/canvas/markupParser.ts`.

## Adding a symbol

1. Add a `SymbolDef` to the right module in `src/symbols/lib/` — geometry on
   the 8px grid, ports on the 4px lattice, `stroke="currentColor"`.
2. Register it in `src/symbols/lib/index.ts` (or its module's array).
3. Extend `tests/symbols/catalog.test.ts` with its id and a geometry check.
4. Eyeball it in the palette (`npm run dev`) at 100% and 200% zoom.

### Custom symbols

Users can import their own SVG symbols (palette → "Import symbol…"). The
sanitizer (`src/import/svgSymbol.ts`) strips scripts, event handlers, and
external references; keep it that way when touching import code.

### Symbol IP rule (non-negotiable)

Symbols must be **authored independently from geometric first principles**
(a gate valve is two triangles; a field instrument is a circle). Never trace,
copy, or vectorize artwork from the ISA-5.1 standard document, vendor
libraries, or other software. Never feed standards documents into AI tools to
generate symbols. PRs that can't establish independent authorship are closed.

## Tests are the contract

Every logic change lands with tests (TDD preferred). UI-only changes need at
minimum a passing build plus the e2e happy path.

## Licensing of your contribution

Merged contributions ship under [PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0](LICENSE) like
the rest of the codebase, and may also be included in commercially licensed
builds under the CLA above. Please add the standard SPDX header to any new
source file:

```ts
// SPDX-License-Identifier: PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0
// Copyright © 2026 Praharsh Nagpure — IPD Studio. Noncommercial use only;
// commercial use requires a paid license (see COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md).
```

Never paste in code from a source whose license you haven't checked, and never
paste in code under a copyleft license (GPL/AGPL) — it cannot be commercially
relicensed and would have to be reverted.
